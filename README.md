# Orator Terms of Service
The Terms of Service liable while using Orator Bot are stated below:

### Personal Data
- While using Orator, you accept that you're allowing us to use your Discord ID, your Discord Server ID and your server's Channel ID for our work.
Reason of usage:
   - __DISCORD ID__: We will use your Discord ID for our: `Premium System` as it is required to save the ID of the user who have our Premium.
   - __SERVER ID__: We will use your Discord Server ID for our: `Setup Language System` as it is required to save which server uses which language as a primary TTS language.
   - __CHANNEL ID__: We will use your Server's Channel ID for our: `Channel Only System` as it is required to know where should the bot be ran and where not.
### Terms to Consider
- We doesn't allow usage of Orator for illegal uses. Making NSFW sounds and other type of TTS messages which aren't allowed to be done in a public voice channel, that can lead to ban of the user or the server owner or the whole server.
Things we consider:
      - If the whole server is liable behind this issue, the server owner will be banned from using Orator and the whole server will get Blacklisted.
      - If a single person is liable behind this, then under certain cases that single person will be banned from using Orator.
- Servers Breaking Discord's ToS can also get banned. Though every cases aren't same and we may consider some of them.
- If your server is found liable, or any user is found liable of doing something illegal, an issue notice will be sent to the Server Owner or an Admin about that issue. And the bot will be removed from the server as a warning. Though clearing data about that server depends on us.
- If we are asked by Discord for taking any steps, we will do it without giving any warnings.
